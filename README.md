Analysis and Detection of Threats in Cloud Environments with Machine Learning: Developed a machine learning-driven threat detection model for cloud environments.


## Abstract


Cloud computing (CC) is a transformative technology that allows on-demand access 
to network and computing resources, such as storage and data management services, based 
on a "Pay as you go" model. It enhances system efficiency and scalability. However, 
despite its many advantages, cloud providers face significant security challenges, 
particularly when it comes to safeguarding cloud environments and services. Ensuring the 
security of these environments is critical, as vulnerabilities can expose sensitive data and 
systems to potential threats. To address these concerns, various solutions, including 
advanced monitoring systems, have been implemented to improve cloud security by 
analyzing resources, services, and network activities to detect suspicious behaviors. In this 
context, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are integral for 
monitoring network traffic and identifying anomalies that may indicate potential threats. 
This mini-project proposes a cloud-based threat detection model that leverages machine 
learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). The RF 
classifier is incorporated to enhance the accuracy (ACC) of the detection model. The 
effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using two datasets, achieving an 
accuracy of 86.4% with the Decision Tree and 100% with the Random Forest classifier, 
demonstrating the potential of Machine Learning in detecting and mitigating threats in 
real-time cloud environments.
